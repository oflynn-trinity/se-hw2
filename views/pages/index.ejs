        <h2>About Chef Owen</h2>
        <p>Chef Owen Flynn was born in a small town in Ohio, where his earliest memories of food were far from extravagant. A notoriously picky eater as a child, he preferred simple meals—grilled cheese, plain pasta, and the occasional well-done burger. Despite his aversion to complex flavors, he found himself fascinated by the art of cooking, drawn to the precision and creativity it demanded.</p>
        <p>Determined to make a career in the kitchen, Chef Owen enrolled in culinary school, where his raw talent quickly set him apart. After working in high-pressure kitchens across the country, he eventually settled in San Antonio, where he opened his first restaurant, an intimate, avant-garde dining experience that earned him three Michelin stars. His dishes are a masterclass in innovation—smoked venison with blackberry gastrique, foie gras with jalapeño-infused honey, and a deconstructed tres leches that defies gravity. Critics rave, customers wait months for a reservation, and the culinary world hails him as a genius.</p>
        <p>But behind the scenes, Chef Owen remains as stubborn about his own eating habits as ever. While his guests indulge in his bold, intricate flavors, he sticks to the same comforting staples he's loved since childhood. His staff has long given up trying to get him to taste his own dishes, knowing he'd rather have a peanut butter sandwich than a plate of caviar.</p>
        <p>Despite his selective palate, Chef Owen's instinct for flavor is unparalleled, allowing him to create dishes that push boundaries while remaining undeniably delicious. His philosophy? “You don't have to eat great food to know how to make it.” And with three Michelin stars under his belt, it's hard to argue with the results.</p>
